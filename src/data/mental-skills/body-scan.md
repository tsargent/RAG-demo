# Body Scan Meditation

A body scan helps reduce racing thoughts and increase physical awareness.

Step 1: Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Close your eyes.  
Step 2: Bring your attention to your toes. Notice sensations without judging.  
Step 3: Gradually move attention up through your legs, hips, torso, arms, and head.  
Step 4: If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the body part you are scanning.

Take 5–10 minutes. The goal is awareness, not relaxation, though relaxation often follows.
