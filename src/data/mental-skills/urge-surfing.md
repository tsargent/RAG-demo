# Urge Surfing

Urge surfing is a mindfulness skill for coping with strong impulses without acting on them.

Step 1: When you notice an urge, pause and name it (e.g., "I feel the urge to...").  
Step 2: Imagine the urge as a wave that rises, peaks, and passes.  
Step 3: Focus on your breath as the "surfboard" carrying you along.  
Step 4: Notice how the intensity changes over time.

Most urges last only a few minutes. The skill is to ride them out without judgment.
