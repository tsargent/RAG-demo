# STOP Skill

STOP is an acronym from DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) for pausing before reacting.

S — Stop: Freeze and do not act on impulse.  
T — Take a step back: Breathe, walk away briefly, or pause.  
O — Observe: Notice what is happening inside and around you.  
P — Proceed mindfully: Choose how to respond with intention.

This technique helps interrupt automatic reactions and creates space for healthier choices.
