# 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Exercise

This technique helps redirect attention to the present moment when feeling overwhelmed.

Step 1: Look around and name 5 things you can see.  
Step 2: Notice 4 things you can touch (the chair, your clothing, an object nearby).  
Step 3: Pay attention to 3 things you can hear.  
Step 4: Identify 2 things you can smell.  
Step 5: Focus on 1 thing you can taste.

Use this sequence slowly, breathing as you go, until you feel calmer.
